# Blog

A full-stack blog site created using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) tech stack.

## Motivation

I built this blog site as a practice project to learn and combine the skills of Reactjs with the new skills I have learned in Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The aim of the project is to create a functional blog site with user authentication and authorization, where users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts and reviews.

## Features

- User login and signup
- Reset password functionality
- Logged-in users can create, update, and delete their own posts
- All users can read posts and comments
- Logged-in users can add, update, and delete comments


## Stack

**Front-end:**
- React.js

**Backend:**
- Node.js
